# PBDB Navigator

## About
Built on the [PBDB API](http://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/), **PBDB Navigator** allows users to explore the Paleobiology Database through space, time, and taxonomy. The application is entirely client-side and depends on external services, including the [Paleobiology Database](http://paleobiodb.org), [GPlates](http://www.gplates.org), and [Phylopic](http://phylopic.org).

You can find the current version at [http://paleobiodb.org/navigator](http://paleobiodb.org/navigator)


## Dependencies
This project requires Node.js, Grunt, and Topojson to be installed. To install Node.js on OS X see the instructions at the bottom of this document. Once Node is installed, you can install Grunt with ````npm install -g grunt-cli```` and Topojson with ````npm install topojson -g````.

## Organization
All working files (the ones you want to edit) are found in the ````assets```` directory, and all files to be used in the application (the compiled and minified versions) are found in the ````build```` directory. Each of the major application components (regular map, reconstruction map, time scale, taxa browser, interface) have their own Javascript file. All interface code is located in ````assets/js/navigator.js````. Grunt combines and minifies all these files into ````build/js/script.min.js````.

## Setup
1. Clone or fork this repository, and navigate into it
2. ````npm install````
3. Start a simple Python server with ````python -m SimpleHTTPServer```` and navigate to localhost:8000 in a web browser. 


## Helpful hints
To:

  * Rebuild the plate cache: ````grunt shell:plates```` then ````grunt shell:badPlates````
  * Rebuild the rotation cache: ````grunt shell:rotations````
  * Rebuild the collections < Phanerozoic cache: ````grunt shell:oldCollections````
  * Validate HTML: ````grunt htmlhint````
  * Concatenate/minify Javascript: ````grunt uglify````
  * Concatenate/minify CSS: ````grunt cssmin````
  * Validate HTML, concatenate/minify Javascript and CSS: ````grunt````

## Setup Node.js on OS X
Adapted from https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814#file-node-and-npm-in-30-seconds-sh :

1. ````echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc````
2. ````. ~/.bashrc````
3. ````cd ~````
4. ````mkdir node-latest````
5. ````cd node-latest````
6. ````curl http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1````
7. ````./configure --prefix=~/local````
8. ````make install```` (Takes a while...might have to agree to XCode terms and conditions here. If you get an XCode error, run ````sudo xcodebuild -license````, view the license, and type ````agree```` to validate)
9. ````curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh````

If you get npm errno -13 with code EACCES while installing grunt, run ````sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local````. This will make you the owner of /usr/local which will make sure you never have to use sudo with npm (via http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm)
